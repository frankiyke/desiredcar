		<p>With the economy in a province of uncertainty and the unemployment rate reaching a whopping 30%, 
		South Africans are increasingly looking for ways to cut their spending while the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic takes its toll. 
		A car can be the biggest expense beyond the cost of living for the average person, so it should come as no surprise 
		that many people will be contemplating putting their cars on the chopping block in the coming weeks and months. 
		Here’s what you need to consider when deciding whether you should sell your car:</p>

              </div>
              <p>After you’ve concluded that you don’t necessarily need a car for your daily livelihood, then you’ll want to calculate 
			  how much you spend on your car to see how much you’ll save by selling it. This includes both your monthly payments and 
			  secondary expenses, such as insurance, gas, maintenance, parking and registration.</p>

			<p>If you still have several months or years of payments left or find yourself out of work, then the potential savings might 
			make selling the car worth your while. On the other hand, if your car is paid off (or close to being paid off) and your 
			employment is secure, then you should consider keeping it until it’s absolutely necessary to sell it.</p>

              <p>The most important question you need to ask yourself is<br /> 
				 “Do I need my car?”
				  If you live in a walkable neighborhood or metro area with easily accessible public transportation, <br  />
				  then a car might be more of a luxury than a necessity. </p> 
				<p>However, if important destinations,
				  such as your job and the grocery store, are miles away from your home with no other available method of transportation,
				  then a car is probably necessary for your day-to-day life.</p>

              <p>If you’re backed into a corner financially and have minimal other options available to you, then selling your car can 
			  provide necessary relief to keep you sustained during this difficult time. Otherwise, it might make sense to keep your 
			  car (for now, at least) if you still have a steady source of income and/or it’s not costing you a significant amount of money each month.</p>
