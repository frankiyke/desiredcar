                    <p>Here are the criteria that Desired Car uses to determine if a vehicle is 4WD (four-wheel drive) or AWD (all-wheel drive). 
					Please note that the names some manufacturers use are marketing terms and do not take into account actual functionality. 
					
					<ul><h5>4WD — Part-Time</h5>
						<li>Four wheels driven or Two wheels driven</li>
						<li>Requires driver input to activate</li>
						<li>Has transfer case with 2-speed capability</li>
						<li>Very good on tough terrain or off-roading.</li>
						<li>Not meant to be driven in 4WD (4WD-Hi or 4WD-low) 
						on high-traction surfaces (dry pavement) or severe damage 
						will occur (because vehicle does not have a center differential 
						to allow different speeds between front and rear axles)</li>					
						<li>For high-traction surfaces (dry pavement) the 2WD mode must be used</li>					
					</ul>
					<ul><h5>4WD — On-Demand</h5>
						<li>Not part-time or AWD but a combination of both types of functionality</li>
						<li>Generally will allow driver to choose several different 4WD modes, including 2WD</li>
						<li>Driver should be able to choose an "AWD" mode</li>
						<li>Center Differential: Manual or Viscous</li>
					</ul>
					
					<ul><h5>4WD — Full-Time</h5>
						<li>Also called Permanent 4WD</li>
						<li>Four wheels driven</li>
						<li>Not part-time or AWD but a combination of both types of functionality</li>
						<li>Generally will allow driver to choose only either 4WD Hi or 4WD Lo modes</li>
						<li>2WD is not available</li>
						<li>Center Differential: Manual or Viscous</li>
						<li>4WD system that can be used on all surfaces (addition of a differential in the transfer case allows for the Full-Time 4WD)</li>
						<li>System was created to make 4WD more usable in everyday driving.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<ul><h5>AWD</h5>
						<li>4 wheels driven</li>
						<li>Selectable electronically controlled modes/settings: available</li>
						<li>4WD-Lo mode is NOT AVAILABLE</li>
						<li>Designed for improved road safety, not intended for off-road use</li>
						<li>Center Differential: Mechanical or Viscous</li>
						<li>Limited Slip: Center</li>
						<li>A drivetrain that employs a front, rear and center differential to provide power to all four wheels of a vehicle.</li>					
					</ul>
					<ul>The short answer is this: AWD and 4WD help a vehicle accelerate in slippery conditions, but they don't aid with braking and only sometimes improve handling. That said, you shouldn't necessarily cross the feature off your shopping list</ul>

                    <p>Automatic Transmission (AT)
					<ul>
						This is a transmission that uses a torque converter, 
						planetary gearset and clutches or bands to shift through a vehicle's forward gears automatically. 
						Some automatics allow the driver a limited amount of manual control over the vehicle 
						(aside from choosing a forward, reverse or neutral mode) -- 
						for example allowing the driver to control upshifts and downshifts by utilizing buttons or paddles on the steering wheel or the gear selector. 
						Common names for such transmissions are "shiftable automatic," "Tiptronic" and "autostick.
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Manual Transmission (MT)
						<ul>
						With a manual transmission, the driver selects all gears manually using both a movable gear selector and a driver-operated clutch. 
						This type of transmission is also known as a "stick shift" or a "standard" transmission. 
						See Manual Transmission Basics for more information.
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>Automated Manual Transmission (AM)
						<ul>						
						Like a manual transmission, an automated manual also employs a mechanical clutch; however, 
						the action of the clutch is not controlled by the driver via the clutch pedal but rather is automated using electronic, 
						pneumatic or hydraulic controls. Sometimes referred to as a "Direct Shift Gearbox" ("DSG") or a "Sequential Manual Gearbox" ("SMG"), 
						this transmission allows for either fully automatic forward gear shifts or manual shifts through the gear selector or 
						through buttons or paddles on the steering wheel.						
						</ul>
					</p>					
					<p>Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)
						<ul>
						This transmission has a continuously variable drive ratio (as opposed to conventionally stepped gear ratios) and uses belts, 
						pulleys and sensors rather than gears to maintain a steady acceleration curve with no pauses for gear changes. Because of this, 
						a CVT can keep the engine in its optimum power range, thereby increasing efficiency and gas mileage.
